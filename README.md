# Foodie
This is a simple project using Laravel framework with some JavaScript and bootstrap functions in the front-end. Also I've used some free website templates to make it look good.

Features-
. This website provides two types of login service, one is for customer and another one is for owner.
. You can order foods from various restaurants from this website as a customer.
. You can add your restaurant and items as a owner of the restaurant, where you will get orders from customers.
